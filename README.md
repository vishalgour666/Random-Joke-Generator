# Random-Joke-Generator
The Random Joke Generator is a fun and interactive web app that fetches and displays a new random joke each time the user clicks a button. It uses a public joke API to retrieve fresh jokes dynamically, making it a simple example of working with APIs, DOM manipulation, and responsive web design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
